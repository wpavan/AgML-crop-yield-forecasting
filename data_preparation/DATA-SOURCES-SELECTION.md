## Soil
We selected data from the [WISE project][global_soil_WISE/README.md] for soil properties. Another choice is [SoilGrids](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids).

WISE soil data is a better choice than SoilGrids for the following reasons:
* agronomic interpretation is easier for WISE compared to SoilGrids.
* SoilGrids did not provide soil rootable depth and water holding capacity (this may have changed recently)
* WISE is based on soil maps whose properties are estimated by expert knowledge collected over the years. For example, in the Netherlands, we see that the performance of [BOFEK](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116123) (similar to WISE) is still considerably better than SoilGrids.

## Crop yield
We selected data from [crop_statistics_DE] for crop (Grain Maize and Wheat) yield. Another choice is [crop_statistics_EU]. crop_statistics_DE is a better choice because of the below mentioned reasons:

- crop_statistics_DE data source for both crops have a longer and harmonized time series (spanning from 1979-2021) available as opposed to dataset from crop_statistics_EU (which is available from 1999-2020).

- For Grain Maize, we have more number of administrative units (= 138), meaning more spatial coverage , compared to the one from crop_statistics_EU which is 12. Whereas,in case of Wheat, the max. admin units in is 376, comapred to 335 in crop_statistics_EU.
